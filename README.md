# Analysis of Political Asymmetries in Misinformation Sharing

This repository provides a Python-based analysis inspired by the study "[Differences in misinformation sharing can lead to politically asymmetric sanctions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07942-8)" published in *Nature*. The analysis investigates the relationship between political orientation and the sharing of low-quality news sources, aiming to replicate key findings from the original study.

## Data

The analysis utilizes a dataset detailing user sharing behaviors on the X (old Twitter) platform during the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The dataset is accessible [here](analysis/mosleh_et_al_data.csv).


## Requirements

To replicate the analysis results, first install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And execute the notebook found [here](analysis/analysis.ipynb).
